# NFL Result Predictor || [```Open in Colab```](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexmekhail/NFLResultPredictor/blob/main/NFL_Result_Predictor.ipynb)

## Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of NFL games using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical NFL game data, the model uses **logistic regression** to forecast the results of upcoming games. The goal is to provide accurate predictions based on key factors and insights from previous matchups.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Processes and analyzes historical NFL game data using **pandas**.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements **logistic regression** to predict game outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model accuracy and iterates for improved performance.
- **Interactive Colab Notebook**: Use and modify the model in real-time with Google Colab.

## Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn (for logistic regression)
- Google Colab (for notebook interactivity)

## Setup
To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexmekhail/NFLResultPredictor.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE or directly use the provided Colab notebook.

## Usage
Download or collect NFL historical game data.
Clean and prepare the data using pandas.
Train the logistic regression model on training data.
Use the model to predict the outcomes of future NFL games.
Evaluate the model’s accuracy and refine it as needed.

## Example Code
Here is an example of how to train the logistic regression model:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Initialize and train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```
